            Please read all instructions carefully!<br/><br/>
            Use the left and right arrow keys to steer the action potential through the axon. As you move left or right
            the action potential will slow down then speed up again when you're not pressing the arrow keys.
            Try to get to the connected neuron in the least amount of time, but try to avoid hitting the sides.

            In this part you only need to focus on the top part. You will see two groups of four neurons. If they are
            exactly the same press the SPACE bar. You have to be as fast as possible. Your reaction time will be shown to you.
            If they are different just wait, they'll go away eventually. Don't worry about the action potential and the
            axon in the lower part; it is a straight path and the arrow keys don't work anyway.<br/><br/> Press N to start the game.

            Alright now it is time to combine the two previous levels. While following the path and avoiding the sides
            look out for matching neurons. Try to reach the connected neuron in the least amount of time. There will be
            three levels back to back, so this is the last instruction screen. Good luck!<br/><br/> Press N to start the game.
